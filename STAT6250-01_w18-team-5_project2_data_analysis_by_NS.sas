in the same directory as this file

title1
'Research Question: What are the total enrollments and dropouts of each gradres in CA high school ( 2014-2015-2016 )?'
;

title2
'Rationale: This provides a comparison between total enrollments and dropouts of 9th to 12th graders in CA high school ( 2014-2015-2016 ).'
;

footnote1
'Above result shows the bar graph of total enrollments and dropouts, sum total by counties and schools.'
;

footnote2
'Moreover, we can see a clear comparison between 2014-2016,i.e decrease in both enrollments and dropouts from 2014 to 2016.'
;

*
Note: This compares these columns "E9, E10, E11, E12, D9, D10, D11, D12" 
from dropouts1415 to the same column names from dropouts1516.

Methodology: First, after combining all datasets during data preparation, 
use sum function in sql procedure to have the totals of individual 9th,
10th, 11th and 12th graders for AY 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 from 
dropouts1415 and dropouts1516 dataset respectively. Populate the correct
values using array function to provide table lookups in the temprary dataset. 
Finally, plotted a graph using proc sgpanel.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for any schools with missing 
data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any ways.

Followup Steps: This graph presents only high level picture of enrollments 
and dropouts for 2014-2016.However, gender distributions with respect to 
enrollments and dropouts are not presented here in this graph.

title1
'Research Question: What are the total male and female enrollments and dropouts ( 2014-15-2016 )?'
;

title2
'Rationale: This would help inform which gender has contributed the most in enrollments and dropouts AY2014-15-2016.'
;

footnote1
'As can be seen, an decrease in numbers of female and male with respect to both enrollments and dropouts from 2014 to 2016.'
;

footnote2
'However, we should know the reason of dropouts from AY 2014-2015-2016.'
;

*
Note: This compares the columns "ETOT, DTOT" from dropouts1415
to the same column from dropouts1516.

Methodology: First, use sum function to the columns 'ETOT' and 'DTOT' 
in mean procedure from sorted datset 'grad_drop_merged_sorted' for 
AY 2014-2015-2016. Finally, plot a graph using proc sgpanel.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for any schools with missing 
data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any ways.And this graphh does
not shows the ethnic categories of genders.Ethnic categories could help us
to peek more into demographic data.

Followup Steps: A possible follow-up to this approach could use an inferential
statistical technique like linear regression.

Note: This compares the column Total from grads1415 to the column TOTAL from
grads1516.

Methodology: After combining grads1415 and grads1516 during data preparation,  
first, use sum function in sql procedure in order to calculate percentage using
columns HISPANIC, AM_IND, ASIAN, PAC_ISLD, FILIPINO, AFRICAN_AM, WHITE, 
TWO_MORE_RACES, NOT_REPORTED and TOTAL from GRAD1415_RAW and GRAD1516_RAW 
dataset. Secondly, created new dataset with raw Data with the input statement.
used arrays function been used to provide table lookups. Finally, sort the final
temporary dataset to print in in tabular format.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for schools with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way. Moreover, this data includes 
summer graduates and does not include students with high school equivalencies, 
such as, General Educational Development (GED) test or California High School 
Proficiency Examination (CHSPE).'

Followup Steps: However, given the magnitude of these numbers, further 
investigation should be performed to ensure no data errors are involved.
