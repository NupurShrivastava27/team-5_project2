Use PROC SQL and the _TYPE_=1 condition to extract the lines from the previously

;
proc sql;
    create table JB2_sorted3 as
    select * from JB2_means2
    where _TYPE_=1
    ;
quit;

*
Because the dropout data is organized with columns containing county and
ethnic code, we need to transpose the data set generated in the previous step
so that the resulting data set contains graduation data with columns for
county and ethnic code, along with the count of graduations for each of those
combinations stored in "COL1"
;
proc transpose data=JB2_sorted3 out=JB2_sorted4;
    by County;
run;

*
Use PROC SQL to generate a new data set from the previous data set that excludes
rows that do not include an ethnic code
;
proc sql;
    create table JB2_sorted5 as
    select * from JB2_sorted4
    where _NAME_ not in ('YEAR', '_TYPE_', '_FREQ_', 'TOT_sum')
    ;
quit;

*
Use PROC FREQ to generate a new data set from the previous data set that adds
a column (PERCENT). For each county, the total number of graduations in
AY2015-2016 is calculated, and then the number of graduates of each ethnicity
within that county is divided by the total graduations in the county to generate
a percentage. The result in PERCENT is 100 times the number of graduates in a
county of a specific ethnicity (Code# in column _NAME_) divided by the total
number of graduates in that county. For example, in row 6 of the resulting data
set, COUNTY is "Inyo", _NAME_ is "Code5", and PERCENT is approximately 72.98.
According to the data dictionary, ethnic code 5 corresponds to Hispanic. This
means that in Inyo County, 72.98% of the graduates in 2016 were Hispanic.
;
proc freq data=JB2_sorted5 noprint;
   tables _NAME_ / out=JB2_sorted8;
   weight COL1;
   by COUNTY ;
run;

*
Create a final data set for graduation data that drops the _NAME_ and COUNT
columns, while creating a new column for a numerical representation of ethnic
code (ETHNIC) that is created by using the substr() function to extract the
number from each "Code#" entry in the _NAME_ field. This step also renames
PERCENT to Grad_percent to be more descriptive for when we later merge it with
the data set that refers to the percentages of students who drop out.
;
data JB2_sorted9(drop=_NAME_ COUNT);
    set JB2_sorted8(rename=(Percent=Grad_percent));
    length ETHNIC 8;
    ETHNIC = substr(_NAME_,5,1);
run;

*
Now that the graduation data set for the counties of interest has been created,
use PROC SQL to start to prepare a data set containing data about the number
of students who dropped out in AY2015-2016 in the counties in question
;
proc sql;
    create table drop_by_county as
    select

    in ('Inyo', 'Stanislaus', 'San Francisco', 'Lassen' ,'Tehama')
    and YEAR = 1516
    ;
quit;

*
Sort the data set generated in the previous step by county and ethnic code,
similar to the structure of the final graduation data set
;
proc sort
        data=drop_by_county
        out=drop_by_county1
    ;

        COUNTY
        ETHNIC

Use PROC MEANS to calculate the total number of dropouts per county in

Use PROC SQL to generate a new data set from the previous data set that includes
only the county, ethnic code, and total number of dropouts per county
;

    select County, Ethnic, DTOT_by_county
    from drop_by_county2
    where _TYPE_ = 3
    ;
quit;

*
Use PROC FREQ to generate a new data set that includes a column PERCENT that
represents the percentage of the total number of students who drop out in each
county who belong to the ethnic group represented by the associated ethnic code.
For example, in row 6 of the resulting data set, COUNTY is "Inyo", ETHNIC is 5,
and PERCENT is approximately 72.98. According to the data dictionary, ethnic
code 5 corresponds to Hispanic. This means that in Inyo County, 72.98% of the
students who dropped out in AY2015-2016 were Hispanic.

proc freq data=drop_by_county3 noprint;
   tables ETHNIC / out=drop_by_county4;

*
Create a new data set from the previous data set that eliminates the COUNT
column and renames PERCENT to Drop_percent to be more descriptive
;
data drop_by_county5(drop=COUNT);
    set drop_by_county4(rename=(Percent=Drop_percent));
run;

*
Create a data set that includes the proportions of graduates of each ethnicity
in the graduating class in each county, as well as the proportions of
ethnicities of students who drop out in each county
