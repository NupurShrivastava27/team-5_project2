STAT6250-01_w18-team-5_project2_data_analysis_by_JB.sas

This file uses four merged data sets to address research questions regarding
graduation and dropout rates for students at schools in California during the
2014-2015 and 2015-2016 academic years.

Data set name: grad_drop_merged_sorted created in external file
STAT6250-01_w18-team-5_project2_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file.

See the file referenced above for data set properties.

title1
'Research Question: What are the top five counties that experienced the greatest increase in ratio of dropouts to enrollments from 2015 to 2016?'
;

title2
'Rationale: We can identify areas where dropouts have increased year over year and examine what can be done to retain students in these areas.'
;

footnote1
'Here we see the five counties with the highest increase in dropout rate from the academic years ending in 2015 to 2016.'
;

footnote2
'The dropout rate for either year is calculated by dividing the total number of students who dropped out in a county by the total enrollment for that county.'
;

footnote3
'The change in dropout rate for each county is the dropout rate for 2015-2016 minus the dropout rate for 2014-2015.'
;


*
Methodology: Using the merged data set, we extract the sum of enrollments and
dropouts for each county using PROC MEANS. From there, we separate the output
into two separate data sets, one for each year, and we calculate the dropout
rate for each year, excluding any counties where total enrollment is less than
50 to remove outliers. We then merge the data sets for each year by county, and
calculate the change in dropout rate from year to year in each county. Finally,
we sort by the descending change in the dropout rate, and print the descriptive
data for the five counties with the greatest increase in dropout rate.

Limitations: In the original data sets, we merged records about graduation and
dropout rate based on CDS code. As a result, there is missing data in some
records in which a CDS code from the dropout records does not appear in the
graduation records or vice versa.

Possible Follow-up Steps: Move the data steps into the data prep file, and do
additional research to see if county names can be located for unmatched CDS
codes.
